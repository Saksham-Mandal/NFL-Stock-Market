# NFL-Stock-Market
NFL Stock Market is a full-stack web application where users trade NFL players like stocks. Each player has a dynamic price that updates based on real-world performance and user demand. Instead of drafting a fantasy team or setting weekly lineups, users build and manage portfolios, track player price movements, and compete on a global leaderboard.
